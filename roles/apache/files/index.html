<h1>Hello darkness, my old friend</h1> <br>
<h1>I've come to talk with you again</h1> <br>
<h1>Because a vision softly creeping</h1> <br>
<h1>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</h1> <br>
<h1>And the vision that was planted in my brain</h1> <br>
<h1>Still remains</h1> <br>
<h1>Within the sound of silence</h1> <br>
<h1>In restless dreams, I walked alone</h1> <br>
<h1>Narrow streets of cobblestone</h1> <br>
<h1>'Neath the halo of a street lamp</h1> <br>
<h1>I turned my collar to the cold and damp</h1> <br>
<h1>When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light</h1> <br>
<h1>That split the night</h1> <br>
<h1>And touched the sound of silence</h1> <br>
<h1>And in the naked light, I saw</h1> <br>
<h1>Ten thousand people, maybe more</h1> <br>
<h1>People talking without speaking</h1> <br>
<h1>People hearing without listening</h1> <br>
<h1>People writing songs that voices never shared</h1> <br>
<h1>And no one dared</h1> <br>
<h1>Disturb the sound of silence</h1> <br>
<h1>"Fools" said I, "You do not know</h1> <br>
<h1>Silence like a cancer grows</h1> <br>
<h1>Hear my words that I might teach you</h1> <br>
<h1>Take my arms that I might reach you"</h1> <br>
<h1>But my words, like silent raindrops fell</h1> <br>
<h1>And echoed in the wells of silence</h1> <br>
<h1>And the people bowed and prayed</h1> <br>
<h1>To the neon god they made</h1> <br>
<h1>And the sign flashed out its warning</h1> <br>
<h1>In the words that it was forming</h1> <br>
<h1>Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls</h1> <br>
<h1>In tenement halls"</h1> <br>
<h1>And whispered in the sound of silence</h1> <br>
